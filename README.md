Berglund's Threads Renderer

Berglund's Threads are an image produced by a function which simulates a laser beinng reflected through an arrangement of cylindrical mirrors.

The origin of the laser is always on a circle of radius 1 around the origin. The place on the circle is controlled by the function's first input, an angle in degrees, and the initial direction is the second input, also an angle in degrees.
The output is the final direction of the laser as it exits the assembly. This may be used to control the brightness of a pixel in an image, or the hue (which accurately reflects the looping nature of the output, being an angle.)
